Two-layer PCB and schematic for interfacing an MQ-2 smoke sensor with Raspberry Pi Pico W. Includes fused 5 V VSYS input, potentiometer for sensitivity, LM393 comparator, and resistor divider scaling the analog signal to 3.3 V ADC (GP26). A red LED with series resistor indicates smoke detection via DOUT. Board features plated mounting holes, test points, solid ground pour, and clear silkscreen labeling for reliable operation.
