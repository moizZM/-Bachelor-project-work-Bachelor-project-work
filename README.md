# Bachelor project work
In progress. Building a small lab safety system. Sensor nodes (Raspberry Pi Pico W) send JSON over TCP to a Python server on my Linux VM. The server checks simple rules and sends commands back (flash LED, fan/beacon, safe power-off via contactor + E-STOP). Messages are newline-JSON for easy parsing.
